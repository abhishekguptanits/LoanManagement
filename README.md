There are couple of requirement/validation
1. The payment date canâ€™t be greater than the Due Date. If its greater we have to reject the Loan and thrown the exception
2. We need to write an aggregation on the remaining amount, Interest and Penalty Group by Lender, Group by Interest and Group by Customer ID.
3. If the Loan crosses the due date, it should write an alert in the log message.
